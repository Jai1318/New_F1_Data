Race strategy is where **data meets decisions** — and it's a goldmine of insights for both performance analysts and teams. You already have the key fact tables (`fact_race_results`, `fact_pit_stops`, `fact_lap_times`), which lets you extract race strategy metrics like:

## 🧠 **Top Race Strategy Insights**

| Insight                       | What It Tells You                      | Why It Matters                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ⛽ **Pit Stop Efficiency**     | Avg stop duration by driver/team       | Fast stops win races                |
| 🛑 **Number of Pit Stops**    | How many times a driver pitted         | Aggressive vs conservative strategy |
| 📉 **Lap of First Pit Stop**  | Early vs late pit timing               | Undercut vs overcut strategy        |
| 🔄 **Pit Impact on Position** | Positional gain/loss after pit         | Strategic decision payoff           |
| 📊 **Lap Time Degradation**   | Tire wear curve before pit             | Helps optimize stint length         |
| 🚦 **Fastest Lap Timing**     | When was it set? Fresh tire advantage? | Critical in tight point races       |
| 🧮 **Race Pace Consistency**  | Lap variance within stint              | Good indicator of tire strategy     |
| 📍 **Strategy by Circuit**    | Avg pit stops per track                | Circuit-specific plans              |

## 💡 Sample DAX Measures for Strategy

### 1. **Pit Stop Count**

```dax
Total Pit Stops := COUNTROWS(fact_pit_stops)
```

---

### 2. **Avg Pit Duration**

```dax
Avg Pit Duration (ms) := AVERAGE(fact_pit_stops[milliseconds])
```

---

### 3. **Lap of First Pit**

```dax
First Pit Lap := 
CALCULATE(
    MIN(fact_pit_stops[lap]),
    ALLEXCEPT(fact_pit_stops, fact_pit_stops[driver_id], fact_pit_stops[race_id])
)
```

---

### 4. **Stint Count (Advanced)**

```dax
Stint Count :=
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(fact_pit_stops[stop]),
    ALLEXCEPT(fact_pit_stops, fact_pit_stops[driver_id], fact_pit_stops[race_id])
)
```

---

### 5. **Lap Time Variance (Race Pace Consistency)**

```dax
Lap Time Variance :=
VAR AllLapTimes = SELECTCOLUMNS(fact_lap_times, "LapMS", fact_lap_times[milliseconds])
RETURN STDEVX.S(AllLapTimes, [LapMS])
```

---

### 6. **Avg Lap Time Before First Pit**

```dax
Avg Lap Pre-Pit :=
VAR FirstPitLap = CALCULATE(MIN(fact_pit_stops[lap]))
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(fact_lap_times[milliseconds]),
    fact_lap_times[lap] < FirstPitLap
)
```

## 🧬 Use Cases

* **Compare teammates:** Same car, different strategy → what worked better?
* **Pit gamble insight:** Did someone pit early and gain positions (undercut)?
* **Tire impact:** Is there a steep drop in lap time near pit window?
* **Constructor strategy difference:** Who plays aggressive vs defensive?

## ⚡ Drill-Down Ideas

| Start                                    | Drill-To |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Circuit → Avg Pit Stops → Race           |          |
| Driver → Pit Timeline → Lap Time per Lap |          |
| Race → Pit Impact → Final Position       |          |
| Constructor → Avg Strategy → Win Rate    |          |
