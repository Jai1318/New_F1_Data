Great! Since you're now working with Power BI (or any tool that supports **DAX**) and have a rich F1 star schema, here are some **powerful insights + DAX code** you can build using your model.

---

## üî• TOP INSIGHTS & DASHBOARDS (with DAX)

---

### üìä 1. **Total Points by Driver**

**Insight:** Show leaderboard of all-time or per-season top drivers.

```dax
Total Points by Driver :=
SUM ( fact_race_results[points] )
```

---

### üìÜ 2. **Races by Weekday (Trend Insight)**

**Insight:** See which days races are typically held.

```dax
Race Count by Weekday :=
COUNTROWS ( dim_race )
```

> Use `dim_date[weekday_name]` as x-axis, and this measure as value.

---

### ü•á 3. **Number of Wins per Driver**

**Insight:** Who has the most race wins?

```dax
Total Wins :=
CALCULATE (
    COUNTROWS ( fact_race_results ),
    fact_race_results[win_flag] = TRUE()
)
```

---

### üèÅ 4. **Average Finish Position per Driver**

**Insight:** Rank drivers by average performance.

```dax
Average Finish Position :=
AVERAGE ( fact_race_results[finish_position] )
```

> Lower = better. Use conditional formatting to highlight top performers.

---

### üß† 5. **Driver Consistency Score**

**Insight:** Standard deviation of positions = consistency

```dax
Position Consistency Score :=
STDEV.P ( fact_race_results[finish_position] )
```

---

### üïê 6. **Fastest Lap Time in Seconds**

**Insight:** Useful for comparing performance across races/circuits

```dax
Fastest Lap (Sec) :=
AVERAGE ( fact_race_results[fastest_lap_time_ms] ) / 1000
```

---

### üóìÔ∏è 7. **Races per Year**

```dax
Races Per Year :=
CALCULATE (
    COUNTROWS ( dim_race ),
    ALLEXCEPT ( dim_race, dim_race[year] )
)
```

---

### üö• 8. **Grid vs Finish Delta**

**Insight:** Measures how much a driver gains/loses from starting grid.

```dax
Grid vs Finish Change :=
AVERAGE ( fact_race_results[grid_position] - fact_race_results[finish_position] )
```

> Positive = lost places, Negative = gained places

---

### üßΩ 9. **Average Pit Stop Time (ms)**

```dax
Average Pit Duration :=
AVERAGE ( fact_pit_stops[milliseconds] )
```

---

### üåç 10. **Revenue Potential by Circuit**

**Insight:** Estimate ticket revenue based on seating

```dax
Estimated Revenue (USD) :=
    SUMX (
        dim_circuit,
        dim_circuit[standard_seating] * dim_circuit[price_general_usd] +
        dim_circuit[vip_seating] * dim_circuit[price_vip_usd] +
        dim_circuit[vvip_seating] * dim_circuit[price_vvip_usd]
    )
```
