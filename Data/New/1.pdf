1. **Top-performing drivers by season**

   * `SUM(points)` grouped by `dim_driver` and `dim_race.year`
   * Track championship trends over time

2. **Best constructors (teams) by points**

   * `SUM(points)` grouped by `dim_constructor`

3. **Grid vs. Finish Position Performance**

   * Compare `grid_position` vs. `finish_position` to see who gains or loses the most places per race

4. **Win ratio by driver/constructor**

   * `% of races where win_flag = true` for each driver or constructor


### ‚è±Ô∏è **Lap Time & Pit Stop Efficiency**

5. **Fastest lap averages per driver/circuit**

   * `AVG(fastest_lap_time_ms)` grouped by driver and/or circuit

6. **Driver consistency over laps**

   * `STDDEV(milliseconds)` in `fact_lap_times` ‚Äî low variation = consistency

7. **Pit stop strategy effectiveness**

   * Compare total pit time vs. race result
   * Optimal number of pit stops and lap number for each stop

### üìÖ **Time/Season Trends**

11. **Performance by Quarter or Month**

* Aggregate points or wins using `dim_date.quarter` or `month_name`

12. **Race Outcomes by Weekday or Weekend**

* See if weekend races yield different results (DNFs, crashes, fastest laps, etc.)

13. **Holiday Races**

* Any trends on performance or attendance when `is_holiday = TRUE`
